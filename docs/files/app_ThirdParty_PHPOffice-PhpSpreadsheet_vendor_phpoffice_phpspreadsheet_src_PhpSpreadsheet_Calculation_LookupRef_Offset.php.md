## Summary (from docblocks)

OFFSET.
Returns a reference to a range that is a specified number of rows and columns from a cell or range of cells.
The reference that is returned can be a single cell or a range of cells. You can specify the number of rows and
the number of columns to be returned.
Excel Function:
       =OFFSET(cellAddress, rows, cols, [height], [width])
@param null|string $cellAddress The reference from which you want to base the offset.
                                    Reference must refer to a cell or range of adjacent cells;
                                    otherwise, OFFSET returns the #VALUE! error value.
@param mixed $rows The number of rows, up or down, that you want the upper-left cell to refer to.
                       Using 5 as the rows argument specifies that the upper-left cell in the
                       reference is five rows below reference. Rows can be positive (which means
                       below the starting reference) or negative (which means above the starting
                       reference).
@param mixed $columns The number of columns, to the left or right, that you want the upper-left cell
                          of the result to refer to. Using 5 as the cols argument specifies that the
                          upper-left cell in the reference is five columns to the right of reference.
                          Cols can be positive (which means to the right of the starting reference)
                          or negative (which means to the left of the starting reference).
@param mixed $height The height, in number of rows, that you want the returned reference to be.
                         Height must be a positive number.
@param mixed $width The width, in number of columns, that you want the returned reference to be.
                        Width must be a positive number.
@return array|int|string An array containing a cell or range of cells, or a string on error
