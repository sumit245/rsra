## Summary (from docblocks)

toBinary.
Return an octal value as binary.
Excel Function:
       OCT2BIN(x[,places])
@param array|string $value The octal number you want to convert. Number may not
                         contain more than 10 characters. The most significant
                         bit of number is the sign bit. The remaining 29 bits
                         are magnitude bits. Negative numbers are represented
                         using two's-complement notation.
                     If number is negative, OCT2BIN ignores places and returns
                         a 10-character binary number.
                     If number is negative, it cannot be less than 7777777000,
                         and if number is positive, it cannot be greater than 777.
                     If number is not a valid octal number, OCT2BIN returns
                         the #NUM! error value.
                     If OCT2BIN requires more than places characters, it
                         returns the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@param array|int $places The number of characters to use. If places is omitted,
                         OCT2BIN uses the minimum number of characters necessary.
                         Places is useful for padding the return value with
                         leading 0s (zeros).
                     If places is not an integer, it is truncated.
                     If places is nonnumeric, OCT2BIN returns the #VALUE!
                         error value.
                     If places is negative, OCT2BIN returns the #NUM! error
                         value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|string Result, or an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

toDecimal.
Return an octal value as decimal.
Excel Function:
       OCT2DEC(x)
@param array|string $value The octal number you want to convert. Number may not contain
                         more than 10 octal characters (30 bits). The most significant
                         bit of number is the sign bit. The remaining 29 bits are
                         magnitude bits. Negative numbers are represented using
                         two's-complement notation.
                     If number is not a valid octal number, OCT2DEC returns the
                         #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|string Result, or an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

toHex.
Return an octal value as hex.
Excel Function:
       OCT2HEX(x[,places])
@param array|string $value The octal number you want to convert. Number may not contain
                         more than 10 octal characters (30 bits). The most significant
                         bit of number is the sign bit. The remaining 29 bits are
                         magnitude bits. Negative numbers are represented using
                         two's-complement notation.
                     If number is negative, OCT2HEX ignores places and returns a
                         10-character hexadecimal number.
                     If number is not a valid octal number, OCT2HEX returns the
                         #NUM! error value.
                     If OCT2HEX requires more than places characters, it returns
                         the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@param array|int $places The number of characters to use. If places is omitted, OCT2HEX
                         uses the minimum number of characters necessary. Places is useful
                         for padding the return value with leading 0s (zeros).
                     If places is not an integer, it is truncated.
                     If places is nonnumeric, OCT2HEX returns the #VALUE! error value.
                     If places is negative, OCT2HEX returns the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|string Result, or an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions
