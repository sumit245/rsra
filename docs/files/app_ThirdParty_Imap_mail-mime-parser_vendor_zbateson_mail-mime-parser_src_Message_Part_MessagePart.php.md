Represents a single part of a message.
A MessagePart object may have any number of child parts, or may be a child
itself with its own parent or parents.
@author Zaahid Bateson

@var PartStreamFilterManager manages attached filters to $contentHandle

@var StreamFactory for creating MessagePartStream objects

@var ParentPart parent part

@var StreamInterface a Psr7 stream containing this part's headers,
     content and children

@var StreamInterface a Psr7 stream containing this part's content

@var string can be used to set an override for content's charset in cases
     where a user knows the charset on the content is not what it claims
     to be.

@var boolean set to true when a user attaches a stream manually, it's
     assumed to already be decoded or to have relevant transfer encoding
     decorators attached already.

Constructor
@param PartStreamFilterManager $partStreamFilterManager
@param StreamFactory $streamFactory
@param StreamInterface $stream
@param StreamInterface $contentStream

Overridden to close streams.

Called when operations change the content of the MessagePart.
The function causes calls to getStream() to return a dynamic
MessagePartStream instead of the read stream for this MessagePart and all
parent MessageParts.

Marks the part as changed, forcing the part to be rewritten when saved.
Normal operations to a MessagePart automatically mark the part as
changed and markAsChanged() doesn't need to be called in those cases.
The function can be called to indicate an external change that requires
rewriting this part, for instance changing a message from a non-mime
message to a mime one, would require rewriting non-mime children to
insure suitable headers are written.
Internally, the function discards the part's stream, forcing a stream to
be created when calling getStream().

Returns true if there's a content stream associated with the part.
@return boolean

Returns true if this part's mime type is text/plain, text/html or has a
text/* and has a defined 'charset' attribute.
@return bool

Returns the mime type of the content.
@return string

Returns the charset of the content, or null if not applicable/defined.
@return string

Returns the content's disposition.
@return string

Returns the content-transfer-encoding used for this part.
@return string

Returns a filename for the part if one is defined, or null otherwise.
@return string

Returns true if the current part is a mime part.
@return bool

Returns the Content ID of the part, or null if not defined.
@return string|null

Returns a resource handle containing this part, including any headers for
a MimePart, its content, and all its children.
@return resource the resource handle

Returns a Psr7 StreamInterface containing this part, including any
headers for a MimePart, its content, and all its children.
@return StreamInterface the resource handle

Overrides the default character set used for reading content from content
streams in cases where a user knows the source charset is not what is
specified.
If set, the returned value from MessagePart::getCharset is ignored.
Note that setting an override on a Message and calling getTextStream,
getTextContent, getHtmlStream or getHtmlContent will not be applied to
those sub-parts, unless the text/html part is the Message itself.
Instead, Message:getTextPart() should be called, and setCharsetOverride
called on the returned MessagePart.
@param string $charsetOverride
@param boolean $onlyIfNoCharset if true, $charsetOverride is used only if
       getCharset returns null.

Returns a resource handle for the content's stream, or null if the part
doesn't have a content stream.
The method wraps a call to {@see MessagePart::getContentStream()} and
returns a resource handle for the returned Stream.
Note: this method should *not* be used and has been deprecated. Instead,
use Psr7 streams with getContentStream.  Multibyte chars will not be read
correctly with fread.
@param string $charset
@deprecated since version 1.2.1
@return resource|null

Returns the StreamInterface for the part's content or null if the part
doesn't have a content section.
The library automatically handles decoding and charset conversion (to the
target passed $charset) based on the part's transfer encoding as returned
by {@see MessagePart::getContentTransferEncoding()} and the part's
charset as returned by {@see MessagePart::getCharset()}.  The returned
stream is ready to be read from directly.
Note that the returned Stream is a shared object.  If called multiple
time with the same $charset, and the value of the part's
Content-Transfer-Encoding header not having changed, the stream will be
rewound.  This would affect other existing variables referencing the
stream, for example:
```
// assuming $part is a part containing the following
// string for its content: '12345678'
$stream = $part->getContentStream();
$someChars = $part->read(4);
$stream2 = $part->getContentStream();
$moreChars = $part->read(4);
echo ($someChars === $moreChars);    //1
```
In this case the Stream was rewound, and $stream's second call to read 4
bytes reads the same first 4.
@param string $charset
@return StreamInterface

Returns the raw data stream for the current part, if it exists, or null
if there's no content associated with the stream.
This is basically the same as calling
{@see MessagePart::getContentStream()}, except no automatic charset
conversion is done.  Note that for non-text streams, this doesn't have an
effect, as charset conversion is not performed in that case, and is
useful only when:
- The charset defined is not correct, and the conversion produces errors;
  or
- You'd like to read the raw contents without conversion, for instance to
  save it to file or allow a user to download it as-is (in a download
  link for example).
@param string $charset
@return StreamInterface

Returns a resource handle for the content's raw data stream, or null if
the part doesn't have a content stream.
The method wraps a call to {@see MessagePart::getBinaryContentStream()}
and returns a resource handle for the returned Stream.
@return resource|null

Saves the binary content of the stream to the passed file, resource or
stream.
Note that charset conversion is not performed in this case, and the
contents of the part are saved in their binary format as transmitted (but
after any content-transfer decoding is performed).  {@see
MessagePart::getBinaryContentStream()} for a more detailed description of
the stream.
If the passed parameter is a string, it's assumed to be a filename to
write to.  The file is opened in 'w+' mode, and closed before returning.
When passing a resource or Psr7 Stream, the resource is not closed, nor
rewound.
@param string|resource|Stream $filenameResourceOrStream

Shortcut to reading stream content and assigning it to a string.  Returns
null if the part doesn't have a content stream.
The returned string is encoded to the passed $charset character encoding,
defaulting to UTF-8.
@see MessagePart::getContentStream()
@param string $charset
@return string

Returns this part's parent.
@return \ZBateson\MailMimeParser\Message\Part\MimePart

Attaches the stream or resource handle for the part's content.  The
stream is closed when another stream is attached, or the MimePart is
destroyed.
@param StreamInterface $stream
@param string $streamCharset

Detaches and closes the content stream.

Sets the content of the part to the passed resource.
@param string|resource|StreamInterface $resource
@param string $charset

Saves the message/part to the passed file, resource, or stream.
If the passed parameter is a string, it's assumed to be a filename to
write to.  The file is opened in 'w+' mode, and closed before returning.
When passing a resource or Psr7 Stream, the resource is not closed, nor
rewound.
@param string|resource|StreamInterface $filenameResourceOrStream

Returns the message/part as a string.
Convenience method for calling getStream()->getContents().
@return string
