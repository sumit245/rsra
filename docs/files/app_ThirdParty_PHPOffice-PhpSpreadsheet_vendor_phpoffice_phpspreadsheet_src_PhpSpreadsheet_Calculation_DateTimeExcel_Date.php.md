## Summary (from docblocks)

DATE.
The DATE function returns a value that represents a particular date.
NOTE: When used in a Cell Formula, MS Excel changes the cell format so that it matches the date
format of your regional settings. PhpSpreadsheet does not change cell formatting in this way.
Excel Function:
       DATE(year,month,day)
PhpSpreadsheet is a lot more forgiving than MS Excel when passing non numeric values to this function.
A Month name or abbreviation (English only at this point) such as 'January' or 'Jan' will still be accepted,
    as will a day value with a suffix (e.g. '21st' rather than simply 21); again only English language.
@param array|int $year The value of the year argument can include one to four digits.
                               Excel interprets the year argument according to the configured
                               date system: 1900 or 1904.
                               If year is between 0 (zero) and 1899 (inclusive), Excel adds that
                               value to 1900 to calculate the year. For example, DATE(108,1,2)
                               returns January 2, 2008 (1900+108).
                               If year is between 1900 and 9999 (inclusive), Excel uses that
                               value as the year. For example, DATE(2008,1,2) returns January 2,
                               2008.
                               If year is less than 0 or is 10000 or greater, Excel returns the
                               #NUM! error value.
@param array|int $month A positive or negative integer representing the month of the year
                               from 1 to 12 (January to December).
                               If month is greater than 12, month adds that number of months to
                               the first month in the year specified. For example, DATE(2008,14,2)
                               returns the serial number representing February 2, 2009.
                               If month is less than 1, month subtracts the magnitude of that
                               number of months, plus 1, from the first month in the year
                               specified. For example, DATE(2008,-3,2) returns the serial number
                               representing September 2, 2007.
@param array|int $day A positive or negative integer representing the day of the month
                               from 1 to 31.
                               If day is greater than the number of days in the month specified,
                               day adds that number of days to the first day in the month. For
                               example, DATE(2008,1,35) returns the serial number representing
                               February 4, 2008.
                               If day is less than 1, day subtracts the magnitude that number of
                               days, plus one, from the first day of the month specified. For
                               example, DATE(2008,1,-15) returns the serial number representing
                               December 16, 2007.
@return mixed Excel date/time serial value, PHP date/time serial value or PHP date/time object,
                       depending on the value of the ReturnDateType flag
        If an array of numbers is passed as the argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

Convert year from multiple formats to int.
@param mixed $year

Convert month from multiple formats to int.
@param mixed $month

Convert day from multiple formats to int.
@param mixed $day
