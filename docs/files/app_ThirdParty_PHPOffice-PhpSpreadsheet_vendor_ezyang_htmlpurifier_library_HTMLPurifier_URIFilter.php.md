## Summary (from docblocks)

Chainable filters for custom URI processing.
These filters can perform custom actions on a URI filter object,
including transformation or blacklisting.  A filter named Foo
must have a corresponding configuration directive %URI.Foo,
unless always_load is specified to be true.
The following contexts may be available while URIFilters are being
processed:
     - EmbeddedURI: true if URI is an embedded resource that will
       be loaded automatically on page load
     - CurrentToken: a reference to the token that is currently
       being processed
     - CurrentAttr: the name of the attribute that is currently being
       processed
     - CurrentCSSProperty: the name of the CSS property that is
       currently being processed (if applicable)
@warning This filter is called before scheme object validation occurs.
         Make sure, if you require a specific scheme object, you
         you check that it exists. This allows filters to convert
         proprietary URI schemes into regular ones.

Unique identifier of filter.
@type string

True if this filter should be run after scheme validation.
@type bool

True if this filter should always be loaded.
This permits a filter to be named Foo without the corresponding
%URI.Foo directive existing.
@type bool

Performs initialization for the filter.  If the filter returns
false, this means that it shouldn't be considered active.
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@return bool

Filter a URI object
@param HTMLPurifier_URI $uri Reference to URI object variable
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@param HTMLPurifier_Context $context
@return bool Whether or not to continue processing: false indicates
        URL is no good, true indicates continue processing. Note that
        all changes are committed directly on the URI object
