## Summary (from docblocks)

Base class for all validating attribute definitions.
This family of classes forms the core for not only HTML attribute validation,
but also any sort of string that needs to be validated or cleaned (which
means CSS properties and composite definitions are defined here too).
Besides defining (through code) what precisely makes the string valid,
subclasses are also responsible for cleaning the code if possible.

Tells us whether or not an HTML attribute is minimized.
Has no meaning in other contexts.
@type bool

Tells us whether or not an HTML attribute is required.
Has no meaning in other contexts
@type bool

Validates and cleans passed string according to a definition.
@param string $string String to be validated and cleaned.
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config Mandatory HTMLPurifier_Config object.
@param HTMLPurifier_Context $context Mandatory HTMLPurifier_Context object.

Convenience method that parses a string as if it were CDATA.
This method process a string in the manner specified at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.2> by removing
leading and trailing whitespace, ignoring line feeds, and replacing
carriage returns and tabs with spaces.  While most useful for HTML
attributes specified as CDATA, it can also be applied to most CSS
values.
@note This method is not entirely standards compliant, as trim() removes
      more types of whitespace than specified in the spec. In practice,
      this is rarely a problem, as those extra characters usually have
      already been removed by HTMLPurifier_Encoder.
@warning This processing is inconsistent with XML's whitespace handling
         as specified by section 3.3.3 and referenced XHTML 1.0 section
         4.7.  However, note that we are NOT necessarily
         parsing XML, thus, this behavior may still be correct. We
         assume that newlines have been normalized.

Factory method for creating this class from a string.
@param string $string String construction info
@return HTMLPurifier_AttrDef Created AttrDef object corresponding to $string

Removes spaces from rgb(0, 0, 0) so that shorthand CSS properties work
properly. THIS IS A HACK!
@param string $string a CSS colour definition
@return string

Parses a possibly escaped CSS string and returns the "pure"
version of it.
