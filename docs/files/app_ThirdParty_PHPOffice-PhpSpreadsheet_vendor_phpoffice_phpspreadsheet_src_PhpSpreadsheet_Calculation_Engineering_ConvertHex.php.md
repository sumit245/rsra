## Summary (from docblocks)

toBinary.
Return a hex value as binary.
Excel Function:
       HEX2BIN(x[,places])
@param array|string $value The hexadecimal number you want to convert.
                     Number cannot contain more than 10 characters.
                     The most significant bit of number is the sign bit (40th bit from the right).
                     The remaining 9 bits are magnitude bits.
                     Negative numbers are represented using two's-complement notation.
                     If number is negative, HEX2BIN ignores places and returns a 10-character binary number.
                     If number is negative, it cannot be less than FFFFFFFE00,
                         and if number is positive, it cannot be greater than 1FF.
                     If number is not a valid hexadecimal number, HEX2BIN returns the #NUM! error value.
                     If HEX2BIN requires more than places characters, it returns the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@param array|int $places The number of characters to use. If places is omitted,
                         HEX2BIN uses the minimum number of characters necessary. Places
                         is useful for padding the return value with leading 0s (zeros).
                     If places is not an integer, it is truncated.
                     If places is nonnumeric, HEX2BIN returns the #VALUE! error value.
                     If places is negative, HEX2BIN returns the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|string Result, or an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

toDecimal.
Return a hex value as decimal.
Excel Function:
       HEX2DEC(x)
@param array|string $value The hexadecimal number you want to convert. This number cannot
                         contain more than 10 characters (40 bits). The most significant
                         bit of number is the sign bit. The remaining 39 bits are magnitude
                         bits. Negative numbers are represented using two's-complement
                         notation.
                     If number is not a valid hexadecimal number, HEX2DEC returns the
                         #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|string Result, or an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

toOctal.
Return a hex value as octal.
Excel Function:
       HEX2OCT(x[,places])
@param array|string $value The hexadecimal number you want to convert. Number cannot
                                   contain more than 10 characters. The most significant bit of
                                   number is the sign bit. The remaining 39 bits are magnitude
                                   bits. Negative numbers are represented using two's-complement
                                   notation.
                                   If number is negative, HEX2OCT ignores places and returns a
                                   10-character octal number.
                                   If number is negative, it cannot be less than FFE0000000, and
                                   if number is positive, it cannot be greater than 1FFFFFFF.
                                   If number is not a valid hexadecimal number, HEX2OCT returns
                                   the #NUM! error value.
                                   If HEX2OCT requires more than places characters, it returns
                                   the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@param array|int $places The number of characters to use. If places is omitted, HEX2OCT
                                   uses the minimum number of characters necessary. Places is
                                   useful for padding the return value with leading 0s (zeros).
                                   If places is not an integer, it is truncated.
                                   If places is nonnumeric, HEX2OCT returns the #VALUE! error
                                   value.
                                   If places is negative, HEX2OCT returns the #NUM! error value.
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|string Result, or an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions
