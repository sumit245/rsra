## Summary (from docblocks)

IPMT.
Returns the interest payment for a given period for an investment based on periodic, constant payments
        and a constant interest rate.
Excel Function:
       IPMT(rate,per,nper,pv[,fv][,type])
@param mixed $interestRate Interest rate per period
@param mixed $period Period for which we want to find the interest
@param mixed $numberOfPeriods Number of periods
@param mixed $presentValue Present Value
@param mixed $futureValue Future Value
@param mixed $type Payment type: 0 = at the end of each period, 1 = at the beginning of each period
@return float|string

ISPMT.
Returns the interest payment for an investment based on an interest rate and a constant payment schedule.
Excel Function:
    =ISPMT(interest_rate, period, number_payments, pv)
@param mixed $interestRate is the interest rate for the investment
@param mixed $period is the period to calculate the interest rate.  It must be betweeen 1 and number_payments.
@param mixed $numberOfPeriods is the number of payments for the annuity
@param mixed $principleRemaining is the loan amount or present value of the payments

RATE.
Returns the interest rate per period of an annuity.
RATE is calculated by iteration and can have zero or more solutions.
If the successive results of RATE do not converge to within 0.0000001 after 20 iterations,
RATE returns the #NUM! error value.
Excel Function:
       RATE(nper,pmt,pv[,fv[,type[,guess]]])
@param mixed $numberOfPeriods The total number of payment periods in an annuity
@param mixed $payment The payment made each period and cannot change over the life of the annuity.
                          Typically, pmt includes principal and interest but no other fees or taxes.
@param mixed $presentValue The present value - the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now
@param mixed $futureValue The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made.
                              If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (the future value of a loan,
                              for example, is 0).
@param mixed $type A number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due:
                     0 or omitted    At the end of the period.
                     1               At the beginning of the period.
@param mixed $guess Your guess for what the rate will be.
                         If you omit guess, it is assumed to be 10 percent.
@return float|string
