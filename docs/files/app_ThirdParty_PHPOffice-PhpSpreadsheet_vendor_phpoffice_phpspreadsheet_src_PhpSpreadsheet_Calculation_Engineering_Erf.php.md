## Summary (from docblocks)

ERF.
Returns the error function integrated between the lower and upper bound arguments.
   Note: In Excel 2007 or earlier, if you input a negative value for the upper or lower bound arguments,
           the function would return a #NUM! error. However, in Excel 2010, the function algorithm was
           improved, so that it can now calculate the function for both positive and negative ranges.
           PhpSpreadsheet follows Excel 2010 behaviour, and accepts negative arguments.
   Excel Function:
       ERF(lower[,upper])
@param mixed $lower Lower bound float for integrating ERF
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $upper Upper bound float for integrating ERF.
                          If omitted, ERF integrates between zero and lower_limit
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|float|string
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

ERFPRECISE.
Returns the error function integrated between the lower and upper bound arguments.
   Excel Function:
       ERF.PRECISE(limit)
@param mixed $limit Float bound for integrating ERF, other bound is zero
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|float|string
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions
