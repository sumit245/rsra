## Summary (from docblocks)

Forgivingly lexes HTML (SGML-style) markup into tokens.
A lexer parses a string of SGML-style markup and converts them into
corresponding tokens.  It doesn't check for well-formedness, although its
internal mechanism may make this automatic (such as the case of
HTMLPurifier_Lexer_DOMLex).  There are several implementations to choose
from.
A lexer is HTML-oriented: it might work with XML, but it's not
recommended, as we adhere to a subset of the specification for optimization
reasons. This might change in the future. Also, most tokenizers are not
expected to handle DTDs or PIs.
This class should not be directly instantiated, but you may use create() to
retrieve a default copy of the lexer.  Being a supertype, this class
does not actually define any implementation, but offers commonly used
convenience functions for subclasses.
@note The unit tests will instantiate this class for testing purposes, as
      many of the utility functions require a class to be instantiated.
      This means that, even though this class is not runnable, it will
      not be declared abstract.
@par
@note
We use tokens rather than create a DOM representation because DOM would:
@par
 -# Require more processing and memory to create,
 -# Is not streamable, and
 -# Has the entire document structure (html and body not needed).
@par
However, DOM is helpful in that it makes it easy to move around nodes
without a lot of lookaheads to see when a tag is closed. This is a
limitation of the token system and some workarounds would be nice.

Whether or not this lexer implements line-number/column-number tracking.
If it does, set to true.

Retrieves or sets the default Lexer as a Prototype Factory.
By default HTMLPurifier_Lexer_DOMLex will be returned. There are
a few exceptions involving special features that only DirectLex
implements.
@note The behavior of this class has changed, rather than accepting
      a prototype object, it now accepts a configuration object.
      To specify your own prototype, set %Core.LexerImpl to it.
      This change in behavior de-singletonizes the lexer object.
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@return HTMLPurifier_Lexer

@var HTMLPurifier_EntityParser

Most common entity to raw value conversion table for special entities.
@type array

Parses special entities into the proper characters.
This string will translate escaped versions of the special characters
into the correct ones.
@param string $string String character data to be parsed.
@return string Parsed character data.

Lexes an HTML string into tokens.
@param $string String HTML.
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@param HTMLPurifier_Context $context
@return HTMLPurifier_Token[] array representation of HTML.

Translates CDATA sections into regular sections (through escaping).
@param string $string HTML string to process.
@return string HTML with CDATA sections escaped.

Special CDATA case that is especially convoluted for <script>
@param string $string HTML string to process.
@return string HTML with CDATA sections escaped.

Special Internet Explorer conditional comments should be removed.
@param string $string HTML string to process.
@return string HTML with conditional comments removed.

Callback function for escapeCDATA() that does the work.
@warning Though this is public in order to let the callback happen,
         calling it directly is not recommended.
@param array $matches PCRE matches array, with index 0 the entire match
                 and 1 the inside of the CDATA section.
@return string Escaped internals of the CDATA section.

Takes a piece of HTML and normalizes it by converting entities, fixing
encoding, extracting bits, and other good stuff.
@param string $html HTML.
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@param HTMLPurifier_Context $context
@return string
@todo Consider making protected

Takes a string of HTML (fragment or document) and returns the content
