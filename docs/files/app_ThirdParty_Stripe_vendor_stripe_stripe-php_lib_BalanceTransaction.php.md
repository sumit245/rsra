Transaction Types</a>.
@property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
@property string $object String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.
@property int $amount Gross amount of the transaction, in %s.
@property int $available_on The date the transaction's net funds will become available in the Stripe balance.

@property null|string $description An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.
@property null|float $exchange_rate The exchange rate used, if applicable, for this transaction. Specifically, if money was converted from currency A to currency B, then the <code>amount</code> in currency A, times <code>exchange_rate</code>, would be the <code>amount</code> in currency B.

Suppose this was converted into 12.34 USD in your Stripe account. Then the BalanceTransaction's <code>amount</code> would be <code>1234</code>, <code>currency</code> would be <code>usd</code>, and <code>exchange_rate</code> would be <code>1.234</code>.
