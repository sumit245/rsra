## Summary (from docblocks)

A UTF-8 specific character encoder that handles cleaning and transforming.
@note All functions in this class should be static.

Constructor throws fatal error if you attempt to instantiate class

Error-handler that mutes errors, alternative to shut-up operator.

iconv wrapper which mutes errors, but doesn't work around bugs.
@param string $in Input encoding
@param string $out Output encoding
@param string $text The text to convert
@return string

Cleans a UTF-8 string for well-formedness and SGML validity
It will parse according to UTF-8 and return a valid UTF8 string, with
non-SGML codepoints excluded.
Specifically, it will permit:
\x{9}\x{A}\x{D}\x{20}-\x{7E}\x{A0}-\x{D7FF}\x{E000}-\x{FFFD}\x{10000}-\x{10FFFF}
Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Char
Arguably this function should be modernized to the HTML5 set
of allowed characters:
https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream
which simultaneously expand and restrict the set of allowed characters.
@param string $str The string to clean
@param bool $force_php
@return string
@note Just for reference, the non-SGML code points are 0 to 31 and
      127 to 159, inclusive.  However, we allow code points 9, 10
      and 13, which are the tab, line feed and carriage return
      respectively. 128 and above the code points map to multibyte
      UTF-8 representations.
@note Fallback code adapted from utf8ToUnicode by Henri Sivonen and
      hsivonen@iki.fi at <http://iki.fi/hsivonen/php-utf8/> under the
      LGPL license.  Notes on what changed are inside, but in general,
      the original code transformed UTF-8 text into an array of integer
      Unicode codepoints. Understandably, transforming that back to
      a string would be somewhat expensive, so the function was modded to
      directly operate on the string.  However, this discourages code
      reuse, and the logic enumerated here would be useful for any
      function that needs to be able to understand UTF-8 characters.
      As of right now, only smart lossless character encoding converters
      would need that, and I'm probably not going to implement them.

Translates a Unicode codepoint into its corresponding UTF-8 character.
@note Based on Feyd's function at
      <http://forums.devnetwork.net/viewtopic.php?p=191404#191404>,
      which is in public domain.
@note While we're going to do code point parsing anyway, a good
      optimization would be to refuse to translate code points that
      are non-SGML characters.  However, this could lead to duplication.
@note This is very similar to the unichr function in
      maintenance/generate-entity-file.php (although this is superior,
      due to its sanity checks).

@return bool

Convert a string to UTF-8 based on configuration.
@param string $str The string to convert
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@param HTMLPurifier_Context $context
@return string

Converts a string from UTF-8 based on configuration.
@param string $str The string to convert
@param HTMLPurifier_Config $config
@param HTMLPurifier_Context $context
@return string
@note Currently, this is a lossy conversion, with unexpressable
      characters being omitted.

Lossless (character-wise) conversion of HTML to ASCII
@param string $str UTF-8 string to be converted to ASCII
@return string ASCII encoded string with non-ASCII character entity-ized
@warning Adapted from MediaWiki, claiming fair use: this is a common
      algorithm. If you disagree with this license fudgery,
      implement it yourself.
@note Uses decimal numeric entities since they are best supported.
@note This is a DUMB function: it has no concept of keeping
      character entities that the projected character encoding
      can allow. We could possibly implement a smart version
      but that would require it to also know which Unicode
      codepoints the charset supported (not an easy task).
@note Sort of with cleanUTF8() but it assumes that $str is
      well-formed UTF-8

No bugs detected in iconv.

Iconv truncates output if converting from UTF-8 to another
 character set with //IGNORE, and a non-encodable character is found

Iconv does not support //IGNORE, making it unusable for
 transcoding purposes

glibc iconv has a known bug where it doesn't handle the magic
//IGNORE stanza correctly.  In particular, rather than ignore
characters, it will return an EILSEQ after consuming some number
of characters, and expect you to restart iconv as if it were
an E2BIG.  Old versions of PHP did not respect the errno, and
returned the fragment, so as a result you would see iconv
mysteriously truncating output. We can work around this by
manually chopping our input into segments of about 8000
characters, as long as PHP ignores the error code.  If PHP starts
paying attention to the error code, iconv becomes unusable.
@return int Error code indicating severity of bug.

This expensive function tests whether or not a given character
encoding supports ASCII. 7/8-bit encodings like Shift_JIS will
fail this test, and require special processing. Variable width
encodings shouldn't ever fail.
@param string $encoding Encoding name to test, as per iconv format
@param bool $bypass Whether or not to bypass the precompiled arrays.
@return Array of UTF-8 characters to their corresponding ASCII,
     which can be used to "undo" any overzealous iconv action.
