## Summary (from docblocks)

BINOMDIST.
Returns the individual term binomial distribution probability. Use BINOMDIST in problems with
       a fixed number of tests or trials, when the outcomes of any trial are only success or failure,
       when trials are independent, and when the probability of success is constant throughout the
       experiment. For example, BINOMDIST can calculate the probability that two of the next three
       babies born are male.
@param mixed $value Integer number of successes in trials
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $trials Integer umber of trials
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $probability Probability of success on each trial as a float
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $cumulative Boolean value indicating if we want the cdf (true) or the pdf (false)
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|float|string
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

@var float

BINOM.DIST.RANGE.
Returns returns the Binomial Distribution probability for the number of successes from a specified number
    of trials falling into a specified range.
@param mixed $trials Integer number of trials
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $probability Probability of success on each trial as a float
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $successes The integer number of successes in trials
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $limit Upper limit for successes in trials as null, or an integer
                          If null, then this will indicate the same as the number of Successes
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|float|string
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

@var float

NEGBINOMDIST.
Returns the negative binomial distribution. NEGBINOMDIST returns the probability that
       there will be number_f failures before the number_s-th success, when the constant
       probability of a success is probability_s. This function is similar to the binomial
       distribution, except that the number of successes is fixed, and the number of trials is
       variable. Like the binomial, trials are assumed to be independent.
@param mixed $failures Number of Failures as an integer
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $successes Threshold number of Successes as an integer
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $probability Probability of success on each trial as a float
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|float|string The result, or a string containing an error
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions
TODO Add support for the cumulative flag not present for NEGBINOMDIST, but introduced for NEGBINOM.DIST
     The cumulative default should be false to reflect the behaviour of NEGBINOMDIST

@var float

BINOM.INV.
Returns the smallest value for which the cumulative binomial distribution is greater
       than or equal to a criterion value
@param mixed $trials number of Bernoulli trials as an integer
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $probability probability of a success on each trial as a float
                     Or can be an array of values
@param mixed $alpha criterion value as a float
                     Or can be an array of values
@return array|int|string
        If an array of numbers is passed as an argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

@return float|int

@var float
