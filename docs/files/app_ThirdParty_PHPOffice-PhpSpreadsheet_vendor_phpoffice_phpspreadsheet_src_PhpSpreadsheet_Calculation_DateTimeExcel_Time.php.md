## Summary (from docblocks)

TIME.
The TIME function returns a value that represents a particular time.
NOTE: When used in a Cell Formula, MS Excel changes the cell format so that it matches the time
format of your regional settings. PhpSpreadsheet does not change cell formatting in this way.
Excel Function:
       TIME(hour,minute,second)
@param array|int $hour A number from 0 (zero) to 32767 representing the hour.
                                   Any value greater than 23 will be divided by 24 and the remainder
                                   will be treated as the hour value. For example, TIME(27,0,0) =
                                   TIME(3,0,0) = .125 or 3:00 AM.
@param array|int $minute A number from 0 to 32767 representing the minute.
                                   Any value greater than 59 will be converted to hours and minutes.
                                   For example, TIME(0,750,0) = TIME(12,30,0) = .520833 or 12:30 PM.
@param array|int $second A number from 0 to 32767 representing the second.
                                   Any value greater than 59 will be converted to hours, minutes,
                                   and seconds. For example, TIME(0,0,2000) = TIME(0,33,22) = .023148
                                   or 12:33:20 AM
        If an array of numbers is passed as the argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions
@return array|mixed Excel date/time serial value, PHP date/time serial value or PHP date/time object,
                       depending on the value of the ReturnDateType flag
        If an array of numbers is passed as the argument, then the returned result will also be an array
           with the same dimensions

@param mixed $value expect int
