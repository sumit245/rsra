SSL utilities for Requests
Collection of utilities for working with and verifying SSL certificates.
@package Requests
@subpackage Utilities

Verify the certificate against common name and subject alternative names
Unfortunately, PHP doesn't check the certificate against the alternative
names, leading things like 'https://www.github.com/' to be invalid.
@see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1 RFC2818, Section 3.1
@throws Requests_Exception On not obtaining a match for the host (`fsockopen.ssl.no_match`)
@param string $host Host name to verify against
@param array $cert Certificate data from openssl_x509_parse()
@return bool

Verify that a reference name is valid
Verifies a dNSName for HTTPS usage, (almost) as per Firefox's rules:
- Wildcards can only occur in a name with more than 3 components
- Wildcards can only occur as the last character in the first
  component
- Wildcards may be preceded by additional characters
We modify these rules to be a bit stricter and only allow the wildcard
character to be the full first component; that is, with the exclusion of
the third rule.
@param string $reference Reference dNSName
@return boolean Is the name valid?

Match a hostname against a dNSName reference
@param string $host Requested host
@param string $reference dNSName to match against
@return boolean Does the domain match?
