## Summary (from docblocks)

Provides methods to normalize and compare URIs.
@author Tobias Schultze
@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6

Default normalizations which only include the ones that preserve semantics.
self::CAPITALIZE_PERCENT_ENCODING | self::DECODE_UNRESERVED_CHARACTERS | self::CONVERT_EMPTY_PATH |
self::REMOVE_DEFAULT_HOST | self::REMOVE_DEFAULT_PORT | self::REMOVE_DOT_SEGMENTS

All letters within a percent-encoding triplet (e.g., "%3A") are case-insensitive, and should be capitalized.
Example: http://example.org/a%c2%b1b → http://example.org/a%C2%B1b

Decodes percent-encoded octets of unreserved characters.
For consistency, percent-encoded octets in the ranges of ALPHA (%41–%5A and %61–%7A), DIGIT (%30–%39),
hyphen (%2D), period (%2E), underscore (%5F), or tilde (%7E) should not be created by URI producers and,
when found in a URI, should be decoded to their corresponding unreserved characters by URI normalizers.
Example: http://example.org/%7Eusern%61me/ → http://example.org/~username/

Converts the empty path to "/" for http and https URIs.
Example: http://example.org → http://example.org/

Removes the default host of the given URI scheme from the URI.
Only the "file" scheme defines the default host "localhost".
All of `file:/myfile`, `file:///myfile`, and `file://localhost/myfile`
are equivalent according to RFC 3986. The first format is not accepted
by PHPs stream functions and thus already normalized implicitly to the
second format in the Uri class. See `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Uri::composeComponents`.
Example: file://localhost/myfile → file:///myfile

Removes the default port of the given URI scheme from the URI.
Example: http://example.org:80/ → http://example.org/

Removes unnecessary dot-segments.
Dot-segments in relative-path references are not removed as it would
change the semantics of the URI reference.
Example: http://example.org/../a/b/../c/./d.html → http://example.org/a/c/d.html

Paths which include two or more adjacent slashes are converted to one.
Webservers usually ignore duplicate slashes and treat those URIs equivalent.
But in theory those URIs do not need to be equivalent. So this normalization
may change the semantics. Encoded slashes (%2F) are not removed.
Example: http://example.org//foo///bar.html → http://example.org/foo/bar.html

Sort query parameters with their values in alphabetical order.
However, the order of parameters in a URI may be significant (this is not defined by the standard).
So this normalization is not safe and may change the semantics of the URI.
Example: ?lang=en&article=fred → ?article=fred&lang=en
Note: The sorting is neither locale nor Unicode aware (the URI query does not get decoded at all) as the
purpose is to be able to compare URIs in a reproducible way, not to have the params sorted perfectly.

Returns a normalized URI.
The scheme and host component are already normalized to lowercase per PSR-7 UriInterface.
This methods adds additional normalizations that can be configured with the $flags parameter.
PSR-7 UriInterface cannot distinguish between an empty component and a missing component as
getQuery(), getFragment() etc. always return a string. This means the URIs "/?#" and "/" are
treated equivalent which is not necessarily true according to RFC 3986. But that difference
is highly uncommon in reality. So this potential normalization is implied in PSR-7 as well.
@param UriInterface $uri   The URI to normalize
@param int          $flags A bitmask of normalizations to apply, see constants
@return UriInterface The normalized URI
@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6.2

Whether two URIs can be considered equivalent.
Both URIs are normalized automatically before comparison with the given $normalizations bitmask. The method also
accepts relative URI references and returns true when they are equivalent. This of course assumes they will be
resolved against the same base URI. If this is not the case, determination of equivalence or difference of
relative references does not mean anything.
@param UriInterface $uri1           An URI to compare
@param UriInterface $uri2           An URI to compare
@param int          $normalizations A bitmask of normalizations to apply, see constants
@return bool
