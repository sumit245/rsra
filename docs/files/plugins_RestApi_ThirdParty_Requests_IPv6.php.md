Class to validate and to work with IPv6 addresses
This was originally based on the PEAR class of the same name, but has been
entirely rewritten.
@package Requests

Uncompresses an IPv6 address
RFC 4291 allows you to compress consecutive zero pieces in an address to
'::'. This method expects a valid IPv6 address and expands the '::' to
the required number of zero pieces.
Example:  FF01::101   ->  FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101
          ::1         ->  0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1

Compresses an IPv6 address
RFC 4291 allows you to compress consecutive zero pieces in an address to
'::'. This method expects a valid IPv6 address and compresses consecutive
zero pieces to '::'.
Example:  FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101   ->  FF01::101
          0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1        ->  ::1
@see uncompress()
@param string $ip An IPv6 address
@return string The compressed IPv6 address

Splits an IPv6 address into the IPv6 and IPv4 representation parts
RFC 4291 allows you to represent the last two parts of an IPv6 address
using the standard IPv4 representation
Example:  0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3
          0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38
@param string $ip An IPv6 address
@return string[] [0] contains the IPv6 represented part, and [1] the IPv4 represented part

Checks an IPv6 address
Checks if the given IP is a valid IPv6 address
@param string $ip An IPv6 address
@return bool true if $ip is a valid IPv6 address
