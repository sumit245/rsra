## Summary (from docblocks)

AMORDEGRC.
Returns the depreciation for each accounting period.
This function is provided for the French accounting system. If an asset is purchased in
the middle of the accounting period, the prorated depreciation is taken into account.
The function is similar to AMORLINC, except that a depreciation coefficient is applied in
the calculation depending on the life of the assets.
This function will return the depreciation until the last period of the life of the assets
or until the cumulated value of depreciation is greater than the cost of the assets minus
the salvage value.
