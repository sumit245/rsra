## Summary (from docblocks)

WEEKNUM.
Returns the week of the year for a specified date.
The WEEKNUM function considers the week containing January 1 to be the first week of the year.
However, there is a European standard that defines the first week as the one with the majority
of days (four or more) falling in the new year. This means that for years in which there are
three days or less in the first week of January, the WEEKNUM function returns week numbers
that are incorrect according to the European standard.
